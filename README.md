Hello ggggg,

## Overview
In this assignment, you will be tasked with building a simple web application using React. The application will demonstrate your ability to create a user-friendly interface, manage state, and implement responsive design principles. 

## Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**: Implement a login and registration form. Users should be able to register with their email and password, and log in to access the application.
   - Use local state management to handle form inputs and validation.
   - Provide feedback for successful or failed login attempts.

2. **Dashboard Display**: After logging in, users should be redirected to a dashboard that displays a welcome message and a list of items (e.g., tasks, notes).
   - Use a mock API to fetch the list of items and display them in a user-friendly manner.
   - Each item should have options to edit or delete.

3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
   - Ensure that all components are accessible and usable on various screen sizes.

## Technical Expectations
- You should use React for building the application.
- State management can be handled using React's built-in hooks (useState, useEffect).
- Styling can be done using CSS Modules or styled-components.
- Ensure code quality with appropriate comments and documentation.

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository containing your code.
- A README file with instructions on how to run the application locally.
- A brief description of your design choices and any challenges you faced during development.

## Time Estimate
We expect this assignment to take approximately 5-7 hours to complete.

## Submission Instructions
Once you have completed the assignment, please create a pull request to submit your work. Ensure that your code is well-organized and follows best practices.

## Final Note
This assignment will be reviewed and discussed in our upcoming interview. We look forward to seeing your work and discussing your approach!
